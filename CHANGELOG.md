## [1.0.7] - 2025-07-29

### Changed
- Bumped extension version to **1.0.7**.  
- Cleaned up and clarified step comments in `utils.addPropertyKey`:  
  - Made ‚Äúcapture source URI‚Äù note optional,  
  - Simplified file‚Äêreading and key‚Äêlisting descriptions,  
  - Renumbered insertion/map/cache/open/cursor steps,  
  - Removed leftover debug output blocks.  
- Always open the properties file in `ViewColumn.One` when revealing after QuickFix.  
- Streamlined cursor placement in `addPropertyKey` to use `lineAt(insertIdx)` for reliable positioning immediately after the `=`.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-07-29

### Changed

* Bumped extension version to **1.0.6** and updated `vscode` dependency to `^1.1.37`.
* Refactored **HoverProvider** to support multiple capture groups (e.g. `start`/`end`/`exception` in `@LogStartEnd`) and cleaned up hover-workflow logging.
* Converted **PropertiesQuickFixProvider** to async, fetching `propertyFileGlobs` from settings, passing the target file path to the add-key command, and registering code actions accordingly.
* Overhauled **utils.addPropertyKey** for:

  * Sorted insertion of new keys into `.properties` (preserving comments/empty lines),
  * Cache invalidation and reload via `loadPropertyDefinitions`,
  * Precise cursor placement immediately after the `=` on the inserted line.
* Streamlined **extension.ts** activation:

  * Integrated `loadPropertyDefinitions` and `isExcludedFile` checks,
  * Restructured the `addPropertyKey` command handler to open, edit, save, and reveal the properties file,
  * Improved validation scheduling for properties and placeholders.

### Added

* Full Jest test coverage for **utils**, **HoverProvider**, **PropertiesQuickFixProvider**, **diagnostics**, and **extension** flows, with complete VS Code API mocks for isolated unit testing.
